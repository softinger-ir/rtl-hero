# RTL Hero  
*A Figma plugin to flip layouts between RTL and LTR.*

---

## 🌍 About

**RTL Hero** helps designers easily switch between **Right-to-Left (RTL)** and **Left-to-Right (LTR)** layouts inside Figma.  
It automatically adjusts text alignment, frame order, and mirroring of nested elements — saving hours of manual re-alignment for bilingual or Arabic/Persian UI projects.

This plugin is built for creators who design for both worlds.

---

## ✨ Key Features (Phase 1)

- Instantly flip layout direction (LTR ↔ RTL)
- Apply mirroring to all nested layers
- Keep spacing and alignment visually consistent
- Non-destructive transformations (safe to revert)

---

## 🚀 Future Plans (Phase 2)

- **Automatic text translation** between English ↔ Persian/Arabic  
- Smart detection of direction based on text content  
- Configurable alignment rules per frame or component

## 🧩 Tech Overview

RTL Hero is built as a lightweight Figma plugin using vanilla JavaScript and HTML.  
No framework overhead — designed for performance and simplicity.
